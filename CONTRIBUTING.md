# Contributing to Promptable

Thank you for considering contributing to **Promptable** 🎉  
Contributions of all kinds are welcome.

This project aims to provide a **high-quality, production-ready open-source knowledge base** for prompt engineering and prompt optimization.

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

Before contributing, please keep these principles in mind:

- **Explicit over implicit**
- **Structure over improvisation**
- **Reliability over cleverness**
- **Actionable knowledge over theory**
- **Distilled expertise over raw documentation**

This is not a collection of prompt “hacks”, but a structured engineering resource.

## 📦 What You Can Contribute

You are welcome to contribute:

- New prompt engineering techniques
- Improvements to existing documentation
- Model-specific behaviors (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Prompt templates
- Prompt anti-patterns and fixes
- Evaluation heuristics
- Automation workflows

## 🚫 What Not to Contribute

Please avoid submitting:

- Raw blog posts or copied articles
- Marketing-oriented content
- Unverified prompt tricks
- Overly speculative or opinion-based claims
- Model hype or comparisons without practical value

## 🗂️ Contribution Guidelines

### File Structure Rules

- One main concept per file or section
- Keep files focused and scoped
- Prefer updating an existing file rather than creating a new one unless necessary

### Writing Style

- Clear, neutral, technical English
- Short paragraphs
- Bullet points where appropriate
- No emojis inside documentation content
- No marketing language

### Content Requirements

Each new technique or section should clearly answer:
- What is it?
- Why it works?
- When to use it?
- When not to use it?
- How it helps prompt optimization?

## 🧪 Testing Your Contribution

Before submitting:
- Re-read your content as if it were used by an automated system
- Ensure the guidance is actionable
- Remove unnecessary verbosity

## 🔀 How to Submit Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`feature/your-change-name`)
3. Commit your changes with a clear message
4. Open a Pull Request
5. Describe **what you added** and **why it matters**
