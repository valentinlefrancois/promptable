# Prompt Optimization Heuristics

Heuristics are practical rules used to improve prompts quickly and reliably.

## Add Constraints When:
- Outputs are inconsistent
- Responses are too verbose
- Tone varies across runs

## Remove Constraints When:
- Creativity is required
- The task is exploratory
- Outputs feel overly rigid

## Add Examples When:
- Format matters
- Style consistency is required
- Classification or transformation is involved

## Avoid Over-Specification
Too many constraints can:
- Reduce output quality
- Create instruction conflicts

## Signal-to-Noise Ratio
Every sentence in a prompt should serve a purpose.
Remove decorative or redundant language.
